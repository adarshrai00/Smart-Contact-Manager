# 📱 Smart Contact Manager

### 🚀 A Real-Life Problem → A Real-World Solution

During my semester exams in Amritsar, I once forgot my phone in the room and urgently needed to call a friend — but I didn’t have his number saved anywhere else.  
That moment sparked an idea 💡 — what if I could access all my important contacts securely from anywhere, anytime?

That’s how **Smart Contact Manager** was born.
